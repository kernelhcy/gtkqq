* TODO Crash problem
* TODO Some code refactor
There are some null pointer access which we haven't enough attention.
These code should be refactor.
* Local group members information cache
Gtkqq will fetch all group members information from qq server when we
open group chat window. It's a so slow process, so we should save
group members information to local disk.
* TODO Notify support
Use libnotify.
* TODO File Transfer
Support Online/Offline file transfer.
