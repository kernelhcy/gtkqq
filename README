GtkQQ is a QQ client. It is written using gtk and based on the webqq protocol.

The webqq protocol is based on the HTTP. 
Visit http://web.qq.com to see it.

Maybe GtkQQ is a browser, whick can only visit http://web.qq.com.
I think there is no copyright problem, because I just write a highly custommed
broswer.
