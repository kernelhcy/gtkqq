This file tells how to build gtkqq from source code. If you are using 
Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu-based Linux distributions, please refer to
https://launchpad.net/~bill-zt/+archive/gtkqq and use PPA for installation.


PREPARE
=======
You need the following packages (or equivalent for your distribution) 
pre-installed on your system:

a) autoconf, the package config system;
b) automake, the make system;
c) required libraries: libtool, libgtk2.0-dev(>=2.24.0), libsqlite3-dev, 
                       zlib1g-dev, autotools-dev,
   libgstreamer0.10-dev, if you want to enable sound support,
   libnotify-dev, if you want to enable notification support.


CONFIGURE
=========
Suppose you've downloaded the source code into directory gtkqq/, enter the
directory first.

$ cd gtkqq/

Then run autogen.sh to generate configure files:

$ ./autogen.sh

After that, begin to configure

$ ./configure

Some useful options for configure:

--enable-unity

  If you are using Ubuntu 11.04 or later distributions, you must use this
  option or you will encounter problems when sending message.
  
--enable-debug

  DEBUG support
  
--prefix=/usr

  Install in the /usr directory instead.
  
--enable-proxy

  proxy support (experimental)

  
BUILD
=====
Run the following command after configure,

$ make

INSTALL
=======
Run the following command if you want to install it into your system

# make install

If you want a package to install, please refer to PACKAGES.

RUN
===
You can run gtkqq from the application menu.
Or directly from terminal:

$ gtkqq


UNINSTALL
=========
To uninstall, run

$ sudo make uninstall
$ ./autoclean.sh
