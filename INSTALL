This file tells how to build gtkqq from source code. If you are using 
Ubuntu or any other Ubuntu-based Linux distributions, please refer to
https://launchpad.net/~bill-zt/+archive/gtkqq and use PPA for installation.


PREPARE
=======
You need the following packages (or equivalent for your distribution) 
pre-installed on your system:

a) autoconf, the package config system;
b) automake, the make system;
c) required libraries: libtool, libgtk2.0-dev(>=2.24.0), libsqlite3-dev, 
                       zlib1g-dev, autotools-dev,
   libgstreamer0.10-dev, if you want to enable sound support,
   libnotify-dev, if you want to enable notification support.


CONFIGURE
=========
Suppose you've downloaded the source code into directory gtkqq/, enter the
directory first.

$ cd gtkqq/

Then run autogen.sh to generate configure files:

$ ./autogen.sh

After that, begin to configure

$ ./configure

Some useful options for configure:
 
--prefix=/usr

  Install in the /usr directory instead (By default it would install in
  /usr/local, you can also change the install directory to anything you
  like).
  

BUILD
=====
Run the following command after configure,

$ make


INSTALL
=======
Run the following command if you want to install it into your system.
Note: you may probably need root permission to install, according to your
install directory defined in configure.

$ sudo make install

If you want a package to install, please refer to PACKAGES.


RUN
===
You can run gtkqq from the application menu.
Or directly from terminal:

$ gtkqq

By the way, you can DEBUG gtkqq if you use parameter "-d":

$ gtkqq -d


UNINSTALL
=========
To uninstall, run the following commands.
Note: you may probably need root permission to uninstall, according to your
install directory defined in configure.

$ sudo make uninstall
$ ./autoclean.sh
