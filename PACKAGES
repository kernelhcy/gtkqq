This file decribes how to build your package so that you can install it.

RPM
===
First be sure you finished 'CONFIGURE' described in INSTALL. Then run
the following commands,

$ cd Packages/rpm
$ make rpm

When you finished it, now you can find your rpm packages in
rpmbuild/x86_64 (for 64-bit) or rpmbuild/i686 (for 32-bit).

Then you can install it with 'rpm'.
